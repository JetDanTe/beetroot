""""A simple calculator.

Create a function called make_operation, which takes in a simple arithmetic operator as a first parameter
(to keep things simple let it only be ‘+’, ‘-’ or ‘*’) and an arbitrary number of arguments (only numbers)
as the second parameter. Then return the sum or product of all the numbers in the arbitrary parameter.
For example:
the call make_operation(‘+’, 7, 7, 2) should return 16
the call make_operation(‘-’, 5, 5, -10, -20) should return 30
the call make_operation(‘*’, 7, 6) should return 42  """

def make_operation(operator, *numbers):
    result = 0
    if operator == '-':
        for i in numbers:
            result -= i
    elif operator == "+":
        result = sum(numbers)
    elif operator == "*":
        result = numbers[0]
        for i in numbers[1:]:
            result *= i
    return result

print(f"Sum of numbers {make_operation('+', 5, 5, 5)}.\n"
      f"Multiplication of numbers {make_operation('*', 4, 4, 4)}.\n"
      f"Difference of numbers {make_operation('-', 5, 5, 5)}.\n")
